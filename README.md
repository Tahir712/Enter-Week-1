# Week 1: Water Quality Prediction Project

## 📌 Description
This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether water is drinkable based on physicochemical parameters.

## 🔢 Dataset
- Name: water_potability.csv
- Features: pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, etc.
- Target: Potability (0 = Not drinkable, 1 = Drinkable)

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📈 Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: ~76% on test data

## 📁 Files
- water_potability.csv
- water_quality_prediction.ipynb

## ✅ Output
The model helps classify whether water is potable or not, based on several input parameters.
